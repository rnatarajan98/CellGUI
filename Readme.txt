To run, make sure to copy the cells.mat file to the same directory as Mat2Py.py, available from the farm or at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.b2t22 under data files

The following modules must be installed:
	1) scipy

easy.



Note: This script previously ran using matlab engine. All of the code required to plot and analyse the 
      data has now been commented out, but can be reincluded. 
      In order to run this, you must install the matlab engine. Google it.
